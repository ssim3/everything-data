# everything data.

Welcome to the everything data. repository! This repository serves as a collection of Jupyter notebooks summarizing the contents from various courses I have learned, covering a wide range of topics from statistics to machine learning. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data enthusiast, you'll find valuable resources and insights within this repository.

# Purpose

In today's data-driven world, knowledge of data analysis and machine learning has become increasingly essential. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of Jupyter notebooks that summarise the concepts, techniques, and algorithms learned from various courses that I have taken and completed. These notebooks are designed to be self-contained, providing explanations, code snippets, and examples for easy understanding and practical application.
